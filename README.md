# HyperJSON

- HyperJSON is simply a collection of JSON schemas that closely resemble HTTP Request and Response messages.
- HyperJSON messages are completely decoupled from any specific application protocol, such as HTTP.

## Message Schemas

- [Request](https://github.com/HyperJSON/HyperJSON-Request)
- [Response](https://github.com/HyperJSON/HyperJSON-Response)
